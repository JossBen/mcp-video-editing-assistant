## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-video-editing-assistant.git
cd mcp-video-editing-assistant

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_editing.txt
```

### 2. DaVinci Resolve Setup

```bash
# Run the setup script to configure Resolve API
python setup_resolve_integration.py
```

**Enable API Access in DaVinci Resolve:**
1. Open DaVinci Resolve
2. Go to Preferences > System > General
3. Enable "External Scripting Using"
4. Restart DaVinci Resolve

### 3. Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "video-editing-assistant": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/project/davinci_resolve_mcp.py"]
    },
    "editing-watcher": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/project/editing_watcher.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Usage

1. **Start DaVinci Resolve** with a project loaded
2. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the MCP servers
3. **Begin learning session:**
   ```
   Ask Claude: "Connect to resolve and start learning my editing patterns"
   ```
